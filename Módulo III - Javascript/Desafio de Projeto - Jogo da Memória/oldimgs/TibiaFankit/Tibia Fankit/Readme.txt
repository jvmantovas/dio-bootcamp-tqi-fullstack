README
------

This fankit is provided free of charge and "as is" which means CipSoft will not customise the contents upon request. You are welcome to customise them to your liking yourself.

By using the elements provided in this fankit, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and accept CipSoft's Video and Screenshot Policy which is included as a .txt file in the fankit. Even though streams are not explicitely mentioned in there, the policy applies to them all the same.

This fankit contains various stuff you can use to spice up your Tibia streaming channel or your videos, for example.

Animated GIFs
-------------

This folder contains animations of various creatures and in-game effects. Best results to preserve the intended look are achieved when using integer scaling only (100%, 200%, ...) and the nearest neighbor algorithm (to preserve crisp pixels). Each GIF comes pre-scaled in three sizes.

Emotes
------

You can use these emotes on your Twitch channel, for example. We provide two variants (Demon Shield and Slime Gobbler), each with 10 different expressions. The emotes are available in three different sizes according to the Twitch guidelines.

Illustrations
-------------

In here you will find various full-screen artworks as well as characters, mounts and creatures isolated with a transparent background that you can use in your own designs.

We also included an illustration in several variants you can use for when your streaming channel is offline, for example.

Overlays
--------

If you want to use Tibia-branded elements for your stream overlay, for example, you will find a couple of elements in here to get you started. The PNG files are blank elements you can use as-is to add your own custom text. The Overlays.psd file can be opened in Adobe Photoshop, the free graphics editor GIMP and other graphics packages. This will allow you to further customise the overlay elements, for example by hiding specific layers you don't need.

The font we recommend to use is "Delitsch Antiqua". You can find it on various free font websites on the internet.

Tibia Logo
----------

Finally, the last folder contains both high- and low-resolution versions of our logo. Additionally, we included an animated version of the Tibia logo in MP4-format that can be superimposed on other material using a magenta key.
